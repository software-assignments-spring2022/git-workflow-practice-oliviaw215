Full stack technology refers to the entire depth of a computer system application, and full stack developers straddle two separate web development domains: the front end and the back end. The front end includes everything that a client, or site viewer, can see and interact with.

Full-stack developers require knowledge in both front end and back end, meaning they are well versed in both discplines. A full stack developer must be well-versed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and know their way around back end technologies and database structures.
